# Pytest With Python :

![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)

pytest is a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy. Tests are expressive and readableâ€”no boilerplate code required. Get started in minutes with a small unit test or complex functional test for your application or library.

Pytest is a testing framework which allows us to write test codes using python. You can write code to test anything like database , API, even UI if you want. But pytest is mainly being used in industry to write tests for APIs.
# Why use PyTest?
* Very easy to start with because of its simple and easy syntax.
* Can run tests in parallel.
* Can run a specific test or a subset of tests
* Automatically detect tests
* Skip tests
* Open source

#### Pre Requisites

  - Making the project as :
    ```
    mkdir pytest-simple-app-demo
	cd pytest-simple-app-demo
    ```
  - Web Scraping installation:
     ```
     open command prompt type 
        pip install virtualenv
     create virtualenv
    	>>virtualenv venv
     we need to activate virtualenv for use
    	>>venv\scripts\activate
     
     need libraries for Web Scraping :
     
    pip install -U pytest
    pytest --version
    ```
  
#### Test files and Test methods
   * By default pytest only identifies the file names starting with test_ or ending with _test as the test files. 
   * Pytest requires the test method names to start with "test."
   
   All other method names will be ignored even if we explicitly ask to run those methods.
 - In order to execute code
    * To run tests only from a specific file
            
            pytest test_TestDemo.py
